# Get the right data without writing SQL

Holistics is a self-service BI platform that enables non-technical users to get access to analytics without bothering data teams.

Once connected to a SQL data warehouse, data teams use Holistics to define the data metrics and prepare well-defined explorable datasets and reports for key data consumers.

Non-technical users can build their own reports with simple, visual report builders.

Every report execution in Holistics will be translated into SQL queries that send to data warehouse. Holistics will visualize the returned results.
